## 📘 Overview

This repository contains **all scripts, data, and computational workflows** used to investigate the **evolution, loss events, and molecular function** of the *APOBEC1* gene across avian species.

The project integrates:

*  **Identify and validate gene loss events**
*  **Phylogenetic analysis**
*  **Selection analysis**
*  **Identify DNA edit sites**
